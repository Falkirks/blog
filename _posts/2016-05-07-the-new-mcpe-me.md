I launched mcpe.me over a year ago and I put it together in a hurry. Now the time has come to fix the mistakes I made and rebuild the service that many servers rely on for their hostnames. And unfortunately that means breaking some things. 

### New features
* An actual user accounts system.
* Ability edit your own records.
* Support for CNAMEs and AAAAs.
* Server verification.
* A public registry.

### Closing the old mcpe.me
The old mcpe.me has been closed and no new records can be created on the website.

### Cleaning out records
After a public vote, I decided to clear the mcpe.me registry and start fresh. This process will occur throughout the month of June.

### Launching
I am planning to launch by the end of June. I will publish a more fixed date, when I figure one out.

I have so many ideas for the new mcpe.me and I am excited for you to see them and use them with your servers.
