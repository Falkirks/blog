I will be updating *most* of my plugins to support PocketMine 1.5 and the new API. I want to provide fast updates which patch bugs while taking advantage of the new features at the same time. I have thought out a plan for making as many people happy as fast as possible. I have organized the schedule by amount of users and then by diffuculty of the update.

<table class="table"><thead><tr><td>Plugin</td><td>Version</td><td>Details</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SimpleWarp</td><td>1.5</td><td>Minor update including better teleports (maybe FastTransfer) and compatibility fixes.</td></tr><tr><td>BuyCraft</td><td>1.2.2</td><td>Minor update bumping API version and fixing bugs.</td></tr><tr><td>TapToDo</td><td>2.1.3</td><td>Minor update bumping API version and fixing bugs.</td></tr><tr><td>BattleKits</td><td>1.0.4</td><td>Fix economy and permission related bugs.</td></tr><tr><td>RankUp</td><td>0.4</td><td>Big bug fixing update.</td></tr><tr><td>Specter</td><td>0.2</td><td>Major update for 0.11 clients.</td></tr><tr><tr><td>DisguiseMe</td><td>2.0</td><td>Large code rewrite for more functionality.</td></tr><td>ChestRefill</td><td>2.0</td><td>Major code rewrite.</td></tr><tr><td>MineReset</td><td>2.0.4</td><td>Fixes to async behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>iControlU</td><td>1.4</td><td>Rewrite system for new API (take advantage of 0.11 stuff)</td></tr><tr><td>Volt</td><td>3.0.3</td><td>Minor update with threading imporvments (3.0.2 should work fine).</td></tr><tr><td>OreFinder</td><td>1.1</td><td>Fix bugs and hopefully speedups.</td></tr></tbody></table>

There are a few plugins which aren't on that list. I do not plan on dropping support for them. They are either of a lower priority or don't expose issues for the 0.11 upgrade.
