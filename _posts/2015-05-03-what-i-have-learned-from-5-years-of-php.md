PHP doesn't have a great reputation among developers. Why? In plain terms, because it sucks. PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf and has been expanded into a hodgepodge of features and paradaims. I agree that PHP as a whole is a bad *language*. That doesn't mean it's a bad *tool* and that doesn't mean that strict subsets of PHP are bad. 

### Just because it works dosen't mean it's good.
This adage is especially important for PHP. For example, you can treat the lanaguage like an advanced templating language and it works. In fact, many people do it. The problem with this is that it produces a code base which is hell to maintain. That said, there isn't a perfect way to do thinsg either. There are many different ways to accomplish a task, it is up to you as a programmer to impose structure on your codebase.
