My PocketMine plugins are bundled with a ***magic*** updater script. 

### How?
It is **really** easy to update a  plugin. All you need to do is open up a terminal window and enter `php [path to .phar]`. The script will check for updates and inform you of any new versions.
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/14716.js" id="asciicast-14716" async></script>
### Support
Currently only a fraction of my plugins support the updater. The script was included in .phar files starting on November 22nd 2014 so only files created on that date or later will have the functionaility.
