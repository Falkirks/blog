>Hello,

>I am contacting you because you have created an account on mcpe.me. This past week a major security incident was disclosed by CloudFlare. You can read the full details at http://falkirks.mailrelay-v.com/newslink/9/1.html. This caused CloudFlare's servers to leak uninitialzed memory into HTTP responses. mcpe.me uses CloudFlare to distribute our content and accelerate page load times. This means that any data or interaction with mcpe.me could have been leaked (including emails, passwords, and all record data). This is a serious issue that was corrected very quickly by CloudFlare upon discovery, however the issue existed for months before it was discovered, allowing time for data to leak.

>CloudFlare contacted me to let me know that none of the mcpe.me data was leaked to a caching service. This doesn't mean it wasn't leaked. Some data may have been leaked to random web visitors who would have just seen arbitrary text and wondered what it was.

>I would highly recommend you update your password on mcpe.me as soon as you can. You should also change your password on any other site that uses CloudFlare (see http://falkirks.mailrelay-v.com/newslink/9/2.html).

>If you have any questions feel free to reply to this email and I will try to get back to you.

>Best,

>Falkirks
